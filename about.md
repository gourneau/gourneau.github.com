#I turn ideas into products, and lead tech teams
___

What I do best is convert ideas into prototypes, then build them into scalable products. I did this for **NASA**, and I can do it for you.  **I have code floating aboard the International Space Station.**

I build using open source software, **Python** is my weapon of choice. I have been building **Django** web applications for [5 years](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8910), and web applications for a decade. I am a contributor to [open source software](http://github.com/gourneau), and an active member of various OSS communities. 

I am currently work at [Ion Torrent](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0117/features-jonathan-rothberg-medicine-tech-gene-machine.html). Ion Torrent is the first company to qualify for the [Genomics X PRIZE](http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/07/new-start-date-and-first-contest.html). At Ion I am the lead web developer of the **Django** and **Twisted** web application that controls our genetic sequencing platforms, the source for this project is on [github](https://github.com/iontorrent/TS/tree/master/dbReports). I have also been the **tech team lead** for this project, along the way I hired and trained new developers, and directed contractors.

I believe in the lean startup philosophy. So I get out of the building and talk to customers to find out what works, and what they need.

###Full stack web developer, among other things
* I build backends including RESTful APIs, I have contibuted to **Tastypie**
* I build frontends with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS (LESS/Bootstrap) 
* I have a strong interest in interactive data visualization, and have used protovis and d3 as well as some WebGL experiments
