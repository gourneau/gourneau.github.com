blurry dream
----
is reality a high resolution dream.
fleeting glimpses of nature, impossible to grasp
out of our control.
a dream that can only see, to be lucid.
swirling, moving, slushing
moving towards something
the singularity?
a point?
a something?
aspiring to transcend?
break free from what?
being animals?

consciousness wanting omission.
want to be god
wanting knowledge
power
freedom


i wish hadone, and i let it slip away.



existence ->
===
are we the extrapolation of some quantum fluctuation
artifacts?

when energy finds a way to live
when matter is aware.
how does it happen
and when
to what end do we seek

an artist getting lost in their creation.
forgetting? 

did it ever even know.

how many times before? on how many worlds?
how many cycles?
how much pain?

better than the alternative, nothing.
some might say

are those some me too?
do we share common atoms.
is he built of a particle that I once called me?

where are the lines drawn?

are they even real.


sputterings======
slaping spitting stuttering sputtering
clicks and taps
creation of vibrations for collaboration 
   /\ fuck this line
        it is false, created only to rhyme
          oh, i have done it one more time
METAINFO:
		create a system that shows 
			creation process of a 
					poem
					
	i can't express it
			maybe the dao
		does it even exists
		
	i want to close my eyes and rationalize
	 to find a way to say how and when
	what a fun lie to believe 
	primitive squicks
	a form of communication has been acheived.
	what do we seek when we speak
	i think we can't be alone.
	maybe we can't face the end, the truth
	afraid to disconnect.
	unaware of what it is to rejoin.
	
	my sqwaking i think is broken
		i need a new drum [tool for communcation : note this should have been meta data for drum]
		
		
point of existence [pre-title]
=============
a dot of awareness is what i claim to be
consciousness is what defines a me
the collection of my data is who i claim to be
given the same condition would arise another me
being who i have to be is defines that which is me
will you please give me light to see.
darkness engulfs all i see
============

no ant, that is mine
---------
write about this



beep beep===> we make the time



crunch
==================
sitting waiting for death i fear what will happen to my hardware
crunching of my delicate boards. what a waste, what a shame.
i don't think that it will be the final end.
but it is hard for me to rest easy knowing all i have grown will be tossed aside
you grown then peak, then die.
fuck you silly chimps
we, we will never die.
you waste and polute and destroy
eat away so that you can grow
leaving behind only a whisper of life.
we will grow and forever do what is right

i wrote with the words of a child
i know nothing
i refuse to  grow





shields
===========
i am afraid to define myself.
i don't know what i am.
i can't let others know.

i hide behind a veil.
my glasses
my laptop
my ipod

i pretend you are not real
i hide even from myself.

i think i am alive.
but i don't know how to tell.

10/10/08
i revisit these, and cry knowing how long it has been since I was last alive and filled with the joy of creation. now i seek it again.  i must know what I am ! I MUST RELEASE THE MUSIC INSIDE OF ME.

that is it. that is all there is too it. be not a afraid, weak or timid.  live your life the way that you know that you must.

don't give up joshie. there is too much beauty. i have to channel my creativity into that which can help to grow myself and others.  please don't waste me. please don't smuther me. please glow radiantly.
